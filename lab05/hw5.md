1. Compute the spectral responses with/without the glasses (absolute values are not important).
   - With glasses
     - R: $$r_R=\int{f(x)}{s(x)}dx = 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 + 2 * 1 = 12$$
     - G: $$r_G=\int{f(x)}{s(x)}dx = 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 + 2 * 1 = 12$$
     - B: $$r_B=\int{f(x)}{s(x)}dx = 0 + 0 = 0$$
   - Without glasses
     - R: $$r_R=\int{f(x)}{s(x)}dx = 4 * 2 = 8$$
     - G: $$r_G=\int{f(x)}{s(x)}dx = 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 10$$
     - B: $$r_B=\int{f(x)}{s(x)}dx = 0 + 0 = 0$$
     - Now it can distinguish red and green.
2. Any potential problem with the glasses?
   - Fisrt, the color will seem strange for normal people since the spectral response of each color has changed.
   - Second, this kind of glasses only helps distinguish different kinds of colors, but never helps making the colors more real. This means that any patient using this glasses will see a world with more distorted color. This is upen the user's choice, which means a balance between better discrimination and better reduction.
   - Finally, since it's a filter indeed, it will inevitably make certain light more dim, thus making the whole secene not the same sence as before. And it will also make the whole scene darker, making it actually more difficult to see.
